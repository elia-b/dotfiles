# My personal dotfile repo

This repository is meant for personal use, but feel free to take inspiration from it or use it.

I took inspiration from [this blog post](https://drewdevault.com/2019/12/30/dotfiles.html).
The only difference is that, instead of using `git add -f filename`, I modify the `.gitignore` accordingly.

My [Neovim configuration](https://github.com/elia-b/NeovimConfig) is separate.
